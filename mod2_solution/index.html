             <p>The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl, 
                 with attributes of wild species such as grey and ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from 
                 Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel.
                 A male that has been castrated is a capon. 
                 An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.</p>
